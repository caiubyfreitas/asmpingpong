# This is a game of Ping Pong written in Assembly that runs
# as a bootable software without the need of any Operation System

# This work was done based on the Tsoding Youtube channel

# To run the program, you have to emulate x86 processor
# and this can be done using e.g. QEMU.

# This is the command line to run "boot" the machine and run it:
qemu-system-x86_64 ping
